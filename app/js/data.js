            description: "The 1975 consists of four childhood friends from Manchester who have played together since their teens. After many attempts, this resulted in The 1975, a name they got from a poetry collection. The singles 'Sex' and 'Chocolate' and their support acts for Muse and the Rolling Stones quickly opened the door to great success. Their untitled debut reached #1 in the UK, as did their latest album 'Being Funny in a Foreign Language' (2022), for the fifth time in a row. They are perfectly on course to make their dream come true: to become one of the greatest bands on Earth. The 1975 is definitely one of the most diverse bands. There isn't really any genre with which they aren't associated. They themselves most enjoy comparisons to My Bloody Valentine, The Streets and Talking Heads. Fun fact: 1975 was the first year Rock Werchter took place.",

The fanatical surfer became a dreamy singer-songwriter whose debut 'Every Kingdom' (2011) featured great songs like 'Only Love', 'Old Pine' and 'Keep Your Head Up'. After that, Howard chose the path of adventure. Every new step was full of surprise. For example, the songs on 'Collections From the Whiteout' (2021) are largely inspired by true stories he picked out of newspapers. The record confirms Howard's status as one of the most innovative songwriters of our time.",

            description: "Fred again.. is inescapable these days; a true phenomenon in modern electronic music. For several years, Fred Gibson (that's the name he was born with) worked in the shadows as a producer and songwriter. He was the driving force behind many hit songs. His work has featured collaborations with George Ezra, Ed Sheeran, Charli XCX, Stormzy, Underworld, and The xx. ​He stepped into the limelight during the COVID-19 pandemic with his Actual Life series, of which the third installment is released today. The often emotional songs start behind the piano and are mixed with beats, sounds he gathers from social media, voice clips, and other samples. This is top-level digital bricolage. With nightlife in lockdown, the single “Marea (We've lost dancing)” becomes the soundtrack to the loss we have experienced, a floor-filler when the world reopens. “Sweat in our shoes, tears in our eyes,” headlined in the weekly HUMO magazine after his performance at the Pukkelpop Festival this summer. Fred again.. is exactly what electronic dance music needed, and the success story continues. In December he will perform a sold-out show at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels. Now Rock Werchter awaits.",

His performance at the showcase festival South By Southwest (SXSW) in 2011 led to a meeting with Sean Combs, a.k.a. Puff Daddy. That night he signed with his label, Bad Boy. Critics praised Machine Gun Kelly (MGK) for his clever use of rap and rock in telling his introspective stories. He loves Eminem and Guns N' Roses in equal measure. Recently, his music has been more punk than hip-hop. In the last few years, Baker has been working closely with Travis Barker, of blink-182 fame. Tellingly, he appears on the covers of 'Tickets to my Downfall' (2020) and 'Mainstream Sellout' (2022) with a guitar around his neck.",

This is only going to gather pace now that Spotify is, from 2021, available in 38 African countries. Adekunle Gold is in the driving seat. He grew up with old Nigerian masters such as King Sunny Adé and Ebenezer Obey and made his debut in 2014 with 'Sade', a remodelling of 'Story of my Life' by One Direction. He is gradually evolving from traditional pop to a more sophisticated sound, and the status of export product. His great dream? To collaborate with Bruno Mars.",

In a few short steps, Gorik van Oudheusden showed that he was a heavyweight, before turning things up a few more gears.

She brings different genres and styles together in her exciting signature style. She unites elements of traditional flamenco with hard beats, electro, pop and R&B. Occasionally, she sneaks in some experimental jazz… or Japanese cuisine (Chicken Teriyaki). She stunned the world with El Mal Querer (2018). On its magnificent successor Motomami (2022), she redefined pop music. Rosalía is a phenomenon. In 2019 she delivered an impressive performance at Rock Werchter - and it looks like she'll do so again in 2023.",

It has the same naive character as their 2007 debut 'Set Your Head On Fire' (2007) and was recorded in the London studio of Andy Savour (Arctic Monkeys, My Bloody Valentine). The duo is also looking back at its illustrious history in other ways. For example, in the summer of 2022 they toured the West Coast of the United States: exactly ten years after their first visit when they performed 'High On A Wire' in front of four million Americans on the David Letterman show.

The soul of the band is in the tendency towards mystical symbolism. Spirituality and religion are at the core. For example, take the name: a portmanteau of the Biblical 'amen' and the Egyptian god Ra. The band from Kortrijk goes deep into everything. They talk about pain and suffering and looking those things straight in the eye. Every album represents processing a trauma. Hence 'Mass' in the title, again and again. 'De Doorn' (2021) is a turning point. Its point of departure is a broader sense of grief and sorrow, and it is also their first fully Dutch-language album. That's a daring move for their first release on the American Relapse Records. However, Amenra's rituals are universal. The band has dedicated fans from Saint Petersburg to Rio de Janeiro.",

She took these influences with her to London, where she studied Creative Musicianship. The ball got rolling in 2019. Millett released her debut single 'Make Me Cry' on COLORS, a platform for young talent on…. YouTube. Her mix of R&B and Soul unleashed a small Millet craze among her five million subscribers. Covid-19 threatened to stifle this hype, but also gave the singer time to work on her magnificent opening gambit 'When Everything is Better, I'll Let You Know' (2022).",
